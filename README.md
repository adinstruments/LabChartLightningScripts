# LabChart Lightning: Template Scripts

[LabChart Lightning](https://adi.to/LabChartLightning)
is the next generation data acquisition and analysis application from
ADInstruments. This repository contains a number of templates that demonstrate
both how to use plugins to extend the functionality within LabChart Lightning,
and how to analyse the data you can export.

---

The repository contains:
 + [`stimulator_scripts/`](./stimulator_scripts): Examples of how to use
   LabChart Lightning's scripting capabilities to output custom stimulus
   waveforms.
 + [`table_analyses/`](./table_analyses): Template scripts for various
   programming languages that show how to run statistical analyses on the
   summary data exported from LabChart Lightning.

The [Lightning Device SDK](https://github.com/adinstruments/LightningDeviceSDK)
allows hardware manufacturers and researchers to connect their data aquisition
devices to LabChart Lightning, and can be found in a separate repository:
<https://github.com/adinstruments/LightningDeviceSDK>.
